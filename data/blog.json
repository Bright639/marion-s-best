Our certified microblading specialists at Spike Salon share everything you need to know about this popular treatment.</p><h3>What is Microblading?</h3><p>Microblading is a form of cosmetic tattooing that creates hair-like strokes to enhance the appearance of eyebrows. Using a manual hand tool with fine needles, pigment is deposited into the upper layers of skin.</p><h3>The Procedure</h3><p><strong>Consultation:</strong> We start with a thorough consultation to understand your desired outcome and assess your natural brow shape and skin type.</p><p><strong>Design:</strong> We carefully measure and draw the new brow shape, ensuring it complements your facial features perfectly.</p><p><strong>Numbing:</strong> A topical anesthetic is applied to minimize discomfort during the procedure.</p><p><strong>Microblading:</strong> Using precise, hair-like strokes, we create natural-looking eyebrow enhancement.</p><h3>Healing and Aftercare</h3><p>The healing process takes about 4-6 weeks. Initially, brows may appear darker but will lighten as they heal. We provide detailed aftercare instructions to ensure optimal results.</p><h3>Touch-ups and Maintenance</h3><p>A touch-up session is scheduled 6-8 weeks after the initial treatment. Results typically last 1-3 years, depending on skin type and lifestyle factors.</p><h3>Who is a Good Candidate?</h3><p>Microblading is ideal for those with sparse, over-plucked, or uneven eyebrows. However, certain conditions may make you unsuitable for the treatment, which we'll discuss during consultation.</p><p>Book a consultation with our certified microblading specialist to see if this treatment is right for you.</p>",

This prevents buildup of oils and debris.</p><p><strong>Brush regularly:</strong> Use a clean spoolie brush to gently separate and fluff your lashes each morning.</p><p><strong>Sleep on your back:</strong> Try to sleep on your back or side to minimize friction against your pillow.</p><h3>What to Avoid</h3><p>• Oil-based products around the eye area<br>• Waterproof mascara (regular mascara is also unnecessary)<br>• Mechanical eyelash curlers<br>• Rubbing or pulling at your lashes<br>• Steam rooms and saunas immediately after application</p><h3>Maintenance Schedule</h3><p>Schedule fill appointments every 2-3 weeks to maintain fullness.
